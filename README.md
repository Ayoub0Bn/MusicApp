**Summer Internship Project (3) with Al-Idhafa Company**

*Date: [01/06/2023 - 31/08/2023]*

Welcome to my Summer Internship Project repository! During my internship with Al-Idhafa company, I had the opportunity to work on an exciting project, and I'm thrilled to share it with you.

**Project Overview:**
In this project, I undertook the challenge of building a simple yet functional Music App. This web-based application allows users to enjoy their favorite music seamlessly, complete with user-friendly features and an aesthetically pleasing design.

**Key Features:**
Audio Playback: The app provides an intuitive audio playback experience, allowing users to listen to their favorite tracks with ease.
Auto-Scrolling Lyrics: Users can follow along with the song lyrics, which automatically scroll as the music plays.
Stylish User Interface: The app boasts a visually appealing and responsive design, ensuring an enjoyable user experience.

**Technologies Used:**
**HTML:** The foundation of the web app's structure and content.
**CSS:** Styling and layout customization for a polished appearance.
**JavaScript:** Functionality enhancements, including auto-scrolling lyrics and user interactions.

*Feel free to explore the code and project files to see how I built this Music App during my internship. Your feedback and contributions are greatly appreciated.

Thank you for visiting my repository, and I hope you enjoy exploring my Summer Internship Project!*
