            <p>Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
                Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror

                Sometimes, all I think about is you
                Late nights in the middle of June
                Heat waves been fakin' me out
                Can't make you happier now
                Sometimes, all I think about is you
                Late nights in the middle of June
                Heat waves been fakin' me out
                Can't make you happier now

                Usually I put somethin' on TV
                So we never think about you and me
                But today I see our reflections
                Clearly in Hollywood, layin' on the screen
                You just need a better life than this
                You need somethin' I can never give
                Fake water all across the road
                It's gone now, the night has come, but

                Sometimes, all I think about is you
                Late nights in the middle of June
                Heat waves been fakin' me out
                Can't make you happier now

                You can't fight it, you can't breathe
                You say something so lovin', but
                Now I gotta let you go
                You'll be better off in someone new
                I don't wanna be alone
                You know it hurts me too
                You look so broken when you cry
                One more and then I say goodbye

                Sometimes, all I think about is you
                Late nights in the middle of June
                Heat waves been fakin' me out
                Can't make you happier now

                Can't make you happier now

                I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
                When you sleep and smile so comfortable
                I just wish that I could give you that
                That look that's perfectly un-sad

                Sometimes, all I think about is you
                Late nights in the middle of June
                Heat waves been fakin' me out
                Heat waves been fakin' me out
